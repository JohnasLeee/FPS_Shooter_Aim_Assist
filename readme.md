# FPS Shooter Aim Assist

This project aims to provide an YOLO-backed aim assist system for FPS (First-Person Shooter) games, designed solely for educational purposes. The objective is to explore the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques in real-time game environments.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how computer vision can be implemented in FPS games. This project is intended to help players who struggle with aiming by demonstrating how technology can enhance their gameplay experience. It is important to note that this project is for educational purposes only and should not be used to gain unfair advantages in competitive games.

## Features

- Real-time Object Detection using YOLOv8
- Automatic Targeting: Automatically moves the mouse to aim at detected opponents.
- Customizable Detection: Supports custom-trained models for specific games or scenarios.
- Efficient Performance: Optimized to run at high for faster response
